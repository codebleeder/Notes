# Behavioral

## Teamwork and collaboration

Here are well-structured answers to the **Teamwork & Collaboration** behavioral questions for a **Senior .NET Developer** role. Each response follows the **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for clarity and impact.  

---

### **1. Tell me about a time you collaborated with a difficult team member. How did you handle it?**  
**Situation:** In one of my projects at Method CRM, I worked with a backend developer who was very resistant to feedback during code reviews.  
**Task:** Our goal was to integrate a new authentication system, but his implementation had security vulnerabilities.  
**Action:** Instead of confronting him directly, I scheduled a one-on-one session to go over the concerns and suggested best practices. I also showed how small changes could improve security without drastically altering his approach.  
**Result:** He appreciated the discussion, made the necessary changes, and became more receptive to feedback in future code reviews.

### **2. Describe a situation where you helped a junior developer with a challenging task.**  
**Situation:** A junior developer in my team struggled to implement an API endpoint using Entity Framework, as he was more comfortable with SQL queries.  
**Task:** He needed to fetch data efficiently while following best practices for performance.  
**Action:** I sat down with him, explained the benefits of Entity Frameworkâ€™s query optimizations, and walked him through a real-world example. I also recommended some resources for further learning.  
**Result:** He successfully implemented the API, gained confidence in EF, and later helped another teammate with a similar task.

### **3. Have you ever disagreed with a team member about a technical approach? How did you resolve it?**  
**Situation:** While designing a caching strategy for a microservice, a colleague wanted to store entire JSON objects in Redis, whereas I preferred caching only the necessary fields to optimize performance.  
**Task:** We needed to agree on the best approach to minimize memory usage while maintaining speed.  
**Action:** I proposed a small proof-of-concept where we tested both approaches under load conditions. We analyzed the memory footprint and response times.  
**Result:** The data showed that caching only necessary fields improved performance without losing essential information. My colleague agreed, and we implemented the optimized approach.

### **4. How do you ensure smooth collaboration between backend and frontend developers?**  
**Situation:** In a project integrating a new payment flow, the frontend and backend teams had misaligned expectations on API responses, causing delays.  
**Task:** We needed clear API contracts to ensure smooth development.  
**Action:** I introduced API documentation using **Swagger** and organized a short sync-up meeting to align request/response formats. I also set up **Postman collections** so frontend developers could test API calls independently.  
**Result:** This reduced miscommunication, minimized rework, and allowed both teams to develop in parallel more efficiently.

### **5. Give an example of how you worked with other teams (QA, DevOps, Product, etc.).**  
**Situation:** In my last role, we had an upcoming release with a critical bug reported by QA, but DevOps had already scheduled the deployment.  
**Task:** We needed to fix the bug without delaying the release.  
**Action:** I worked with QA to reproduce the issue quickly, diagnosed the root cause, and implemented a fix. I also collaborated with DevOps to deploy a patch immediately after the release to avoid rollback.  
**Result:** The release went live as planned, and the patch resolved the issue without customer impact.  

## Problem solving and debugging
Here are well-structured answers to the **Problem-Solving & Debugging** behavioral questions for a **Senior .NET Developer** role, following the **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result).  

---

### **1. Tell me about a time you faced a critical production issue. How did you diagnose and fix it?**  
**Situation:** After a release at Method CRM, users reported that they were unable to log in using Single Sign-On (SSO). This was a critical issue as it affected a large number of customers.  
**Task:** My goal was to diagnose and resolve the issue as quickly as possible to minimize downtime.  
**Action:**  
- I immediately checked the logs and found multiple authentication failures.  
- Used **Application Insights** to trace the issue and discovered that the **token expiration time** wasn't properly handled.  
- After reproducing the issue in a dev environment, I modified the authentication flow to correctly refresh expired tokens.  
- Deployed a hotfix after thorough testing.  
**Result:** The issue was resolved within 2 hours, restoring user access. We later implemented **additional monitoring alerts** to catch similar issues early.

### **2. Describe a challenging bug you encountered and how you resolved it.**  
**Situation:** A scheduled job for invoice generation was failing intermittently in production, but no errors were being logged.  
**Task:** I needed to find the root cause and ensure invoices were processed reliably.  
**Action:**  
- Checked logs but found no obvious exceptions.  
- Used **distributed tracing** in Application Insights to track the jobâ€™s execution path.  
- Discovered that a **deadlock issue in SQL Server** was preventing certain queries from executing under high load.  
- Optimized the database queries by **adding proper indexing and switching to a retry mechanism** for deadlock scenarios.  
**Result:** The fix eliminated job failures, and invoice generation became 100% reliable under peak loads.

### **3. Have you ever optimized a slow-performing .NET application? What steps did you take?**  
**Situation:** A .NET API endpoint that fetched user analytics was taking **8â€“10 seconds** to respond, frustrating customers.  
**Task:** I needed to reduce the response time to **under 2 seconds**.  
**Action:**  
- **Profiled the API using Application Insights & SQL Profiler** to identify bottlenecks.  
- Found that the endpoint was making **multiple sequential database calls** instead of a single optimized query.  
- Refactored the logic to use **a single efficient SQL query with proper indexing**.  
- Introduced **caching with Redis** to store frequently accessed analytics data.  
**Result:** Response time dropped to **~500ms**, leading to a much better user experience.

### **4. Share an example of how you handled an unexpected system failure.**  
**Situation:** A microservice handling user notifications **crashed in production** during a high-traffic period, causing delays in email and push notifications.  
**Task:** My goal was to restore the service quickly while identifying the root cause.  
**Action:**  
- Checked **Azure logs and metrics**â€”found that the service was running out of memory due to unbounded message processing.  
- Restarted the service to restore functionality temporarily.  
- Implemented **rate limiting and optimized memory usage** by processing messages in smaller batches.  
- Set up **automatic scaling rules in Azure** to prevent future failures.  
**Result:** Notifications were restored within 30 minutes, and the system remained stable under load.

### **5. Tell me about a time when you had to refactor a piece of legacy code.**  
**Situation:** A monolithic .NET application had **a huge, unmaintainable method (~800+ lines of code)** handling order processing. Any small change risked breaking functionality.  
**Task:** I needed to refactor it into a **cleaner, more maintainable structure** while ensuring no regressions.  
**Action:**  
- Broke the method into **multiple smaller functions** following **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**.  
- Introduced a **state machine pattern** to handle different order statuses in a modular way.  
- Wrote **unit tests** to validate the behavior after refactoring.  
**Result:** The new structure was **easier to debug and extend**, and the team was able to introduce new order features much faster.
